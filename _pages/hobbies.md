In my leisure time, I find joy in a variety of activities that enrich my life. I am an avid cook, exploring the culinary world with enthusiasm. I particularly enjoy trying new cuisines and cooking various dishes, finding inspiration in flavors from around the globe. Long-distance running and hiking allow me to connect with nature and challenge my physical limits. Skiing, with its exhilarating slopes, is another passion that I indulge in whenever I can. Solving puzzles stimulates my mind and sharpens my problem-solving skills. Additionally, I have a penchant for learning new skills and thrive on taking on new projects, constantly seeking opportunities for personal and professional growth.
