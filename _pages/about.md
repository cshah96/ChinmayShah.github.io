I am a devoted robotics enthusiast with a strong drive to push the boundaries of technology. My passion lies in constructing robots, and I aspire to leverage this enthusiasm to create impactful devices that enhance people's lives.

## Research Interest
My primary goal is to draw inspiration from nature and leverage that knowledge to create cutting-edge robots. My current research focuses on developing innovative robotics solutions inspired by understanding the dynamics of human motion. I aim to comprehend and apply these principles in combination with some learning methods to develop robust control algorithms for humanoids and exoskeletons.

## What I bring to the table

To follow this passion of mine I recently joined the Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) in Florida, where my research centers on the development of control algorithms for an augmentative exoskeletons. Before IHMC, I worked as a robotics control systems engineer, contributing to the path planning stack for an autonomous delivery robot. 

Prior to that, I held a role as a Research Assistant at the Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Engineering Lab (NREL) at North Carolina State University under the guidance of Dr. Helen Huang. In this capacity, I developed embedded control systems for wearable robots, including a powered ankle prosthesis designed to aid amputees in regaining biological function and performing everyday tasks. I relished my time at the lab, reveling in the opportunity to learn new things and tackle challenging problems.

With over eight years of experience, I have contributed to projects spanning autonomous mobile robots, wearable robots, and automobile design as well. My expertise lies in controls, embedded systems, software, mechanical design, and manufacturing, creating a well-rounded skill set essential for the design, development, and control of robotic systems across diverse applications.

Working at all of these places has nurtured my passion for robotics and provided me with the opportunity to contribute to products that can make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I find joy in running, hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and solving puzzles in my free time.
