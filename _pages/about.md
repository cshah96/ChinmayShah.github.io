I am a Robotics Control Systems Engineer at DEKA Research and Development, where I work with a talented team to develop an autonomous delivery robot for FedEx. My main focus is on developing path planning and control algorithms.

Prior to joining DEKA, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Engineering Lab (NREL) at North Carolina State University. In this role, I developed embedded control systems for wearable robots, including a powered ankle prosthesis designed to help amputees regain biological function and perform everyday tasks. My master's degree in mechanical engineering, completed under the guidance of Dr. He (Helen) Huang, focused on developing a continuous myoelectric controller for a powered ankle prosthesis. This controller allows users to control the device by activating their residual muscles, making non-repetitive tasks possible, such as adjusting their ankle angle at will to avoid obstacles. I absolutely enjoyed my time at the lab as I love to learn new things and have fun working on challenging problems. 

During my undergraduate studies, I served as the Captain of Team Endurance Racing, an off-road racing team that designed and built a vehicle for competition in BAJA SAE. This experience gave me knowledge in mechanical design, manufacturing, design validation, and FEA while developing a custom powertrain system. 

Over the past eight years, I've worked on various projects in Mobile robots, Human-Robot Interaction, Rehabilitation robotics, and automobile design, focusing on Embedded systems and Controls, design, and manufacturing. My exposure to the state-of-the-art in Embedded systems and Control, along with my mechanical design and manufacturing skills, have helped me develop a well-rounded skillset required for Design, Development, and Control of Robotic systems for a wide range of applications.

Working at DEKA and the NREL Lab has instilled in me a passion for robotics and the opportunity to work on products that can make a significant impact on people's lives. 

 In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and playing the piano.
