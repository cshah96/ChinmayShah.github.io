I am a dedicated robotics enthusiast with a fervent interest in pushing the boundaries of technology. My current research revolves around drawing inspiration from nature to pioneer innovative robotics solutions. Specifically, my focus lies in understanding the intricate dynamics of human locomotion, and I aim to comprehend and apply these principles in the development of humanoids and exoskeletons. My overarching goal is to bridge the efficiency of nature with cutting-edge robotics, exploring ways to augment machine capabilities by harnessing insights from the grace of natural movement. I am committed to propelling the field of robotics forward through interdisciplinary exploration and continuous learning.

To follow this passion of mine I recently joined the Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) in Florida, where my research centers on the development of diverse control algorithms for augmentative exoskeletons.

Before joining IHMC, I worked as a robotics control systems engineer, contributing to the path planning stack for an autonomous delivery robot. Prior to that, I held a role as a Research Assistant at the Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Engineering Lab (NREL) at North Carolina State University under the guidance of Dr. Helen Huang. In this capacity, I developed embedded control systems for wearable robots, including a powered ankle prosthesis designed to aid amputees in regaining biological function and performing everyday tasks. I relished my time at the lab, reveling in the opportunity to learn new things and tackle challenging problems.

During my undergraduate studies, I assumed the role of Captain for Team Endurance Racing, an off-road racing team that designed and built a vehicle for BAJA SAE competition. This experience equipped me with expertise in mechanical design, manufacturing, design validation, and FEA, all while developing a custom powertrain system.

With over eight years of experience, I have contributed to projects spanning mobile robots, human-robot interaction, rehabilitation robotics, and automobile design. My expertise lies in embedded systems and controls, design, and manufacturing, creating a well-rounded skill set essential for the design, development, and control of robotic systems across diverse applications.

Working at all of these places has nurtured my passion for robotics and provided me with the opportunity to contribute to products that can make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I find joy in running, hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and indulging in playing the piano in my free time.
