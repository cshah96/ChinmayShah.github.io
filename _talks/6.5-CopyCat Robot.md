## CopyCat Pipeline

Developed a complete pipeline for a 6-DOF robotic manipulator with the capability to identify a hand-drawn shape and then pick up a pen to replicate the same shape on a piece of paper. 

To achieve this, a custom shape detection algorithm was created, enabling the arm to recognize various hand-drawn shapes. Additionally, a custom inverse kinematic solver was developed to empower the arm to pick up the pen and execute trajectories for drawing different shapes.

The video demonstrates the complete pipeline. The robot points the camera to the hand drawn shape, then the algorithm detects and identifies the shape, once that's done it pickups a pen and executes the trajectory of the identified shape.
