After graduation, I sought out a job where I could work on impactful technology and gain experience in taking an idea from concept to market-ready product. I found my passion at Deka Research and Development as a Robotics Control Systems Engineer, where I developed path planning control algorithms for a last-mile delivery robot and a autonomous security robot.

Over the past year, I have learned a great deal while working on a package delivery robot for FedEx. Additionally, I have worked on developing an autonomous security robot capable of patrolling parking lots, offices, and warehouses. I assisted in the development of a high-level controller responsible for selecting different behaviors of the robot depending on the situation it encountered, such as whether it was on a road, sidewalk, or in an intersection. The behavior planner would switch between modes as needed based on the situation and surface it was driving on.

I experimented with multiple path planning algorithms such as Djikstraâ€™s, A*, and grassfire, allowing the robot to autonomously plan the shortest and most efficient path while navigating through the real world with multiple dynamic and static obstacles. These higher-level planned paths were provided to a lower level model predictive controller, which was responsible for reacting to fast-changing real-world scenarios and safely navigating through them. I also assited with the developement of a collision check library that evaluated multiple dynamic obstacles around the robot, and trained a machine learning model to generate predicted trajectories for these obstacles. These predictions were then used to evaluate potential collisions and avoid them, providing an additional layer of safety.
