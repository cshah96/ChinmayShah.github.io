For our Non-Linear Controls class project, we implemented three different non-linear controllers - Exact Model Knowledge control, adaptive control, and robust control - for a 2-DOF robotic manipulator. Our goal was to enable the manipulator to track a specified target trajectory.
As part of the project, we also had to prove the Lyapunov stability of all the controllers in the presence of external disturbances and unknown model parameters. We then simulated the designed controllers using MATLAB and Simulink, and evaluated their performance for a simple position tracking task.
