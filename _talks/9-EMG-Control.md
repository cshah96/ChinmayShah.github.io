## Master's Thesis

I developed an EMG-driven neuromuscular model-based controller for volitional control of a robotic ankle prosthesis, enabling the user to perform unpredictable and non-repetitive tasks. Autonomous control systems do not consider the user's intent while performing a task, as they are preprogrammed to execute a specified action based on the interaction with the environment. This makes them highly susceptible to unknown disturbances, leading to faults and errors that may cause a lack of balance and result in the user falling and sustaining injuries.

To address this issue, the developed controller uses EMG signals from the muscle to allow the user to relay intent to the device, replicating the human neuromuscular system where muscles and joints are replaced by robotic joints controlled by a mathematical model of the muscle that also accounts for human intent. The force generated by the muscle depends not only on the neural signal but also on the muscle states. The virtual ankle joint model developed here consisted of two hill-type muscle lumped parameter models representing all the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors.

The model was trained using EMG signals and biomechanical data collected during level ground walking at different speeds. Offline simulations and human subject testing was conducted to validate model performance and observe its performance across different tasks it was not trained for. 

This was the first controller to be implemented in real-time on a robotic prosthetic device and tested while performing unpredictable, non-repetitive tasks. The results of this study were presented at [IROS 2022.](https://cshah96.github.io/ChinmayShah.github.io//publications/2-Paper/)
