I contributed to the development of a robotic ankle prosthesis that restores 1 degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) motion to the user. Conceptualized and developed the embedded control system and data acquisition system to allow for real-time control and monitoring of the prosthesis. The novel design included a variable stiffness spring that allowed the user to easily adjust the stiffness and range of motion of the device. The device's range of motion can be adjusted by adding or removing bevel discs, or using different stiffness bevel discs, enabling it to perform a variety of tasks with optimum performance.

This enabled the the user to perform level ground walking and stair climbing. 

The results of this study were presented at [IROS 2021.](https://cshah96.github.io/ChinmayShah.github.io//publications/1-Paper/)
