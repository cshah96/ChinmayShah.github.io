The project involved the design and manufacturing of a custom tunable continuously variable transmission (CVT) system to improve acceleration performance without sacrificing top-speed performance. The CVT system is a centrifugal clutch system set up with a V belt driven pulley system that allows for a smooth transition between high and low gear ratios.

By developing a custom CVT system, the team was able to tune the performance depending on different events of the competition. For instance, in traction-specific events, they were able to delay the transition, providing high initial torque required to start pulling a heavy load. Similarly, they could adjust the system for acceleration events and the 4-hour endurance race where top speed is important.

One of the significant achievements of the project was the reduction in weight of the custom CVT by 1.5kg, which was 25% less than the OEM CVT used previously. Moreover, the acceleration improved by around 0.25 seconds, while also improving top-speed performance by around 10% on another setting.

The team also developed a custom electronic tuning system that allowed the user to adjust the CVT to extract peak performance during different applications/events. Finally, the team was among the top four teams out of all 160 teams that attempted to develop a custom continuously variable transmission system.

Overall, the project appears to be a success, as the team was able to develop a custom CVT system that provided better performance than the OEM CVT system while also reducing weight and enabling tunability.
