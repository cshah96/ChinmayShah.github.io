I developed a finite state control system for a robotic ankle prosthesis to facilitate level ground walking and stair climbing. By breaking these cyclic tasks down into various phases, a finite state machine was implemented. The controller uses sensor data to monitor the state of the ankle and execute the appropriate impedance strategy. We conducted a study to evaluate the performance of the device and controller during these tasks, analyzing biomechanical data to calculate the ankle angle and torque generated by the device during the gait cycle using inverse kinematics and kinetics.

This enabled the the user to perform level ground walking and stair climbing. 

The results of this study were presented at [IROS 2021.](https://cshah96.github.io/ChinmayShah.github.io//publications/1-Paper/)
