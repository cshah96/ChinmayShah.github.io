After graduation, I sought out a job where I could work on impactful technology and gain experience in taking an idea from concept to market-ready product. I found my passion at Deka Research and Development as a Robotics Control Systems Engineer, where I was responsible on working on the development of the path planning stack for a last-mile delivery robot and a autonomous security robot.

After graduation, I actively sought a position that would allow me to contribute to impactful technological advancements and gain hands-on experience in bringing innovative concepts to market-ready products. It was at Deka Research and Development that I was able to work on my passion while working on advance technology that could help improve peoples lives. In this role, I took on the responsibility of contributing to the development of the path planning stack for both a last-mile delivery robot and an autonomous security robot.

Throughout the past year, I have undergone significant professional growth while actively participating in the creation of an autonomous system capable of safely navigating complex and dynamic environments. One of my initial challenges involved assisting in the development of a higher-level controller known as the behavior planner. This intricate system not only laid down the global path but also effectively coordinated various controllers to execute appropriate behaviors in diverse situations, such as navigating intersections, traversing roads or sidewalks, and yielding to pedestrians.

During rigorous testing, we identified a considerable challenge in deploying the system in real-world scenarios, particularly when confronted with dynamic obstacles. To address this, we engineered a collision check library, implementing a hierarchical collision monitoring system. This system utilized predictions from machine learning-based algorithms to systematically check for potential collisions with the robot's trajectory. If a potential collision was detected, evasive actions were swiftly taken, resulting in a significant reduction in collision incidents by approximately 16%.

Following a project transition from an autonomous delivery robot to a security robot, our team faced a fresh set of challenges, particularly in operating within indoor narrow office spaces. Navigating these confined spaces required meticulous attention to detail, as even slight errors in perception could impede the efficiency of the path planning stack. To overcome this, we introduced a reachability cost layer and a Euclidean distance-based cost layer for the Model Predictive Controller (MPC), enabling the system to cease planning paths through narrow spaces or over obstacles when necessary. This adaptive approach ensured effective navigation in challenging indoor environments.

Beyond my involvement in the autonomous delivery robot project at DEKA, the company offers a multitude of smaller projects that provide exposure to diverse technological endeavors. Keen on broadening my experience, I opted to contribute to medical device development. I recently became part of an initiative focused on crafting a capacitive deionization-based reverse osmosis water purification system tailored for a home care hemodialysis machine.

In this venture, the capacitive deionization technology emerged as a pivotal solution, enhancing the lifespan of the RO filter and mitigating maintenance costs. Within this context, my role encompassed the development of intricate control systems designed to regulate various deionization and reverse osmosis cycles. The objective was to ensure the seamless and efficient operation of the system to successfully fullfill the requirements of the hemo dialysis machine.
