I led the development of a custom powertrain system that enabled us to reduce the weight of our vehicle and gain a significant performance advantage. While it's often tempting to use OEM powertrain systems to save on design time and manufacturing cost, these systems are typically bulky and non-tunable. Moreover, they are designed for heavier vehicles, which can make it challenging to extract maximum performance from them.

By developing a completely custom powertrain system, we were able to reduce the weight of the vehicle and fine-tune its performance to meet our specific requirements. This gave us a significant advantage in terms of speed, agility, and overall performance.

## Development of a Custom 2-Stage Compound Gearbox

The continuously variable transmission alone could not provide the required amount of torque, necessitating the design and manufacture of a 2-stage compound gearbox. Manufacturing our own gearbox was a challenging endeavor, but it allowed us to achieve some interesting weight reductions. Through the process, I gained valuable knowledge about tolerances and bearing selections. We also discovered that gear design standards typically assume millions of life cycles, but by knowing the hours-of-service life of our gears, we could significantly reduce their size.

We designed a custom aluminum casing that reduced the overall weight of the gearbox by approximately 2.5 kg (a 35% reduction) compared to the previous year's gearbox, while still maintaining the required transmission ratio for the appropriate amount of torque. To keep the gearbox cool and maintain peak performance during the 4-hour race, we developed an efficient cooling solution to reduce wear and tear.

## Development of a Composite Velocity Joint

A CV joint is a special joint that connects the driveshaft to the wheels, transferring torque to the wheel while also allowing for the axial movement of the shaft. This axial movement frees the driveshaft from any axial load as the wheel moves up and down over bumps or uneven terrain. However, this movement also causes the joint to experience a lot of frictional forces, leading to frictional wear. While an aluminum joint would be tough enough to withstand torsional forces, it would not be able to withstand frictional wear.

To overcome this problem, we designed a custom aluminum joint with a 2mm thin steel insert that would take care of the frictional wear. This allowed us to reduce the weight of the CV joints by about 40%, or 1.5kg each. As a result, we won the runner-up award in the technological innovation category for employing an out-of-the-box solution.

However, this innovative solution presented a significant manufacturing challenge. It was very difficult to manufacture a precise 2mm thin insert that would perfectly fit inside an aluminum casing. To make the insert 2mm thin without warping, we employed non-conventional manufacturing processes such as wire cutting and EDM (Electron Discharge Machining).
