I led a team of 25 students in designing, manufacturing, and building an off-road vehicle to compete in the BAJA SAE India competition. BAJA SAE is a competition where students from various universities design and build an off-road vehicle to compete against each other in events such as acceleration tests, suspension, and traction events, and a final 4-hour endurance race. The competition presents a unique challenge as all teams must use the same engine, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the vehicle's design.

As a budding mechanical engineer, I gained a great deal of theoretical knowledge through my courses, but the workshop was where I was able to apply these concepts practically, solidify my understanding, and experiment with innovative ideas. Above all, I had a lot of fun doing it.

Reliability is a significant concern in BAJA SAE due to the demanding nature of the events. It was fascinating to apply innovative solutions to powertrain design to ensure reliability while also developing a system that was lightweight and efficient.

In my third year on the team, I became the captain and head of powertrain design. As captain, it was essential to ensure that younger team members received the appropriate exposure and experience to develop their skills and knowledge so that they could continue to advance development in the future. It was also crucial to delegate work efficiently and plan deadlines to ensure sufficient time for designing, manufacturing, and, most importantly, testing.
