**Abstract:** Ankle joints play key roles in everyday locomotion, such as walking, stair climbing, and sit-to-stand. Despite the achievement in designing powered prosthetic ankles, engineers still face challenges to duplicate the full mechanics of ankle joints, including high torque, large range of motion (ROM), low profile, backdrivability, and efficiency, using electric motors and related transmissions. In this study, our goal was to develop a new active prosthetic ankle, Variable Spring embedded Motor-ball screw (VSeM) ankle, to meet all these requirements at the same time. Using a manually adjustable elastic element, which is parallel with our motor actuator, we can readjust the ROM of VSeM to handle all normal locomotion tasks. VSeM’s capability to mimic human ankle was validated through both bench tests and human subject tests.
